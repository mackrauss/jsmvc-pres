Why use MVC?
- help get more done with less code
- can hinder you however
- Don't use it for everything you do

Angular
- seriously advanced code that is hard to understand
- dirty checking (Am I different?) - digest cycle to see if something is different
- Don't track more than 2000 variables ;)
- one dirty comparison shouldn't take more than 25 (u)sec
- hard to work outside the framework
 Caution: Super easy to put logic on the DOM with ng-click and others. Avoid this. Just call function
 Put $http calls in service not into Controller
- Don't use Angulars official router use Angular UI router

Ember
- two way binding via accessor methods on objects (messier syntacs)
- more efficient data checking
- no scaling problem like Angular
- hard to work outside the framework

Backbone
- two-way databinding like Ember but not free
- no black magic hence bare bones
- very flexible
- nothing is for free
- one could rip out Backbone's views and put in ReactJS
- marionette, chaplin, thorax will give you more

React
- two-way databinding isn't free but easy
- not and MVC
- no model underneath it
- constructs a virtual DOM and compares it with the actual DOM
- super fast
- the v in MVC
- pairs nicely with Backbone or other Frameworks
- allows serverside pre-rendering in node (since it is Javascript virtual DOM :)
